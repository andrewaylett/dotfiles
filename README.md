# Andrew's dotfiles

These are (some of) my dotfiles.  They're here because I want to share them
between machines, and also because there's nothing secret in them and it's
occasionally helpful to reference them.

Please feel free to copy any snippets you find useful.  If you publish the
result, I'd appreciate an acknowledgement -- and please do let me know, too!  I
recommend _not_ using this repository directly, unless you are me.
